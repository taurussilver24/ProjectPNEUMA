The corpus spans one speaker including studio-quality recordings, 30 TTS families, 500 generatively variant subsets, 10 bona fide neural-processing variants, and more than 3 million utterances. This variation-dense design enables robust speaker-conditioned anti-spoofing and fine-grained synthesis-source tracing.

We identify three key challenges: dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience. To bridge this gap, we introduce Trainee-Bench, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a 'trainee' agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, Trainee-Bench evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by dissecting generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning. Our work establishes a framework for assessing agent reliability, shifting evaluation from static tests to realistic, production-oriented scenarios.

Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an M/G/1 queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.",30.31,13.492,409,warm,LFM-2.5,Apple_M1(Metal)

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1×1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model’s internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness.

Our approach introduces SVGFormer, a decoder-free pipeline built upon a content-aware grouping stage that partitions the volume into a semantic graph of supervoxels. Its hierarchical encoder learns rich node representations by combining a patch-level Transformer with a supervoxel-level Graph Attention Network, jointly modeling fine-grained intra-region features and broader inter-regional dependencies. This design concentrates all learnable capacity on feature encoding and provides inherent, dual-scale explainability from the patch to the region level. To validate the framework’s flexibility, we trained two specialized models on the BraTS dataset: one for node-level classification and one for tumor proportion regression. Both models achieved strong performance, with the classification model achieving an F1-score of 0.875 and the regression model a MAE of 0.028, confirming the encoder’s ability to learn discriminative and localized features. Our results establish that a graph-based, encoder-only paradigm offers an accurate and inherently interpretable alternative for 3D medical image representation.",31.85,13.781,439,warm,LFM-2.5,Apple_M1(Metal)
