However, current GraphRAG methods are constrained by a static, pre-constructed Knowledge Graph (KG) paradigm, which faces challenges of incomplete paths and misleading facts. To address these, we propose Relink, a framework that dynamically builds a query-specific evidence graph. Relink instantiates required facts from a latent relation pool derived from the original text corpus, repairing broken paths on the fly. It employs a unified, query-aware evaluation strategy to select the most useful facts for answering the query.

Standard methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are gradient-blind, preserving high-variance dimensions regardless of their impact on factual knowledge preservation. We introduce Fisher-Aligned Subspace Compression (FASC), a knowledge-aware compression framework that selects subspaces by directly modeling activation-gradient coupling, minimizing a second-order surrogate of the loss function. FASC leverages the Fisher Information Matrix to identify dimensions critical for factual knowledge, often residing in low-variance but high-gradient-sensitivity subspaces. We propose the Dependence Violation Score (ρ) as a general-purpose diagnostic metric that quantifies activation-gradient coupling, revealing where factual knowledge is stored within transformer architectures. Extensive experiments on Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B demonstrate that FASC preserves 6-8% more accuracy on knowledge-intensive benchmarks (MMLU, LAMA) compared to variance-based methods at 50% rank reduction, effectively enabling a 7B model to match the factual recall of a 13B uncompressed model. Our analysis reveals that ρ serves as a fundamental signal of stored knowledge, with high-ρ layers emerging only when models internalize factual associations during training.",27.44,12.792,351,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Two complementary training signals are examined: forward chain-of-thought generation, which trains the model to produce correct reasoning traces, and backward verification, which trains the model to verify and acknowledge errors in candidate solutions. Experiments on GSM8K reveal a fundamental trade-off between these objectives. Forward-only DPO training achieves the highest accuracy improvement, increasing from 83.1% to 86.6% (+3.5 percentage points), while backward-only training yields minimal accuracy gains but substantially reduces the false positive rate from 13.4% to 4.3%. Notably, both training variants reduce acknowledgement rate compared to the baseline, suggesting that preference optimization increases model confidence in its outputs. These findings indicate that forward and backward reasoning objectives provide distinct and complementary learning signals: forward training improves problem-solving capability, while backward training improves verification calibration.

Existing defenses focus on data selection but rely on heuristic, instance-level assessments that neglect the global geometry of the data distribution and fail to explicitly repel harmful patterns. To address this, we introduce Safety Optimal Transport (SOT), a novel framework that reframes safe fine-tuning as a distribution-level alignment task grounded in Optimal Transport (OT). SOT optimizes sample importance by actively pulling the downstream distribution towards a trusted safe anchor while simultaneously pushing it away from a general harmful reference, establishing a robust geometric safety boundary that effectively purifies the training data. Extensive experiments across diverse model families and domains demonstrate that SOT significantly enhances model safety while maintaining competitive downstream performance, achieving a superior safety-utility trade-off compared to baselines.",26.68,11.055,295,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

However, most unlearning methods require the unlearning requesters to upload their data to the server, which is infeasible in privacy-preserving scenarios. This paper explores how to implement unlearning without revealing the erasing data to the server. We propose Blind Unlearning (BlindU), which uses compressed representations instead of original inputs. BlindU only involves the server and the unlearning user, with the user generating privacy-preserving representations locally and the server performing unlearning solely on these representations and their labels. For FL model training, we employ the information bottleneck (IB) mechanism. The encoder of the IB-based FL model learns representations that distort maximum task-irrelevant information from inputs, allowing FL users to generate compressed representations locally. For effective unlearning using compressed representation, BlindU integrates two dedicated unlearning modules tailored explicitly for IB-based models and uses a multiple gradient descent algorithm to balance forgetting and utility retaining. The paper also introduces a noise-free differential privacy (DP) masking method to deal with raw erasing data before compressing. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate the superiority of BlindU in privacy protection and unlearning effectiveness compared with existing benchmarks.",28.07,12.292,345,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Current data arbitration strategies often rely on surface-level heuristics that fail to diagnose intrinsic learning needs. Since SFT targets pattern consolidation through imitation while RL drives structural adaptation via exploration, misaligning data with these functional roles causes severe optimization interference. We propose PRISM, a dynamics-aware framework grounded in Schema Theory that arbitrates data based on its degree of cognitive conflict with the model’s existing knowledge. By analyzing the spatial geometric structure of gradients, PRISM identifies data triggering high spatial concentration as high-conflict signals that require RL for structural restructuring. In contrast, data yielding diffuse updates is routed to SFT for efficient consolidation. Extensive experiments on WebShop and ALFWorld demonstrate that PRISM achieves a Pareto improvement, outperforming state-of-the-art hybrid methods while reducing computational costs by up to 3.22 ×.

However, this shift introduces input contexts that are inherently noisy, a reality that current benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce NoisyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates model robustness across 11 datasets in RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks against diverse noise types, including random documents, irrelevant chat histories, and hard negative distractors. Our evaluation reveals a catastrophic performance drop of up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Crucially, we find that agentic workflows often amplify these errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs, and distractors can trigger emergent misalignment even without adversarial intent. We find that prompting, context engineering, SFT, and outcome-reward only RL fail to ensure robustness; in contrast, our proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) significantly strengthens resilience by incentivizing the identification of helpful information within noise. Finally, we uncover an inverse scaling trend where increased test-time computation leads to worse performance in noisy settings and demonstrate via attention visualization that models disproportionately focus on distractor tokens, providing vital insights for building the next generation of robust, reasoning-capable agents.",28.02,13.131,368,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

This comparison identifies aspects that are either unusually emphasized or missing relative to domain norms and integrates them into the generated text. In a user study across three accommodation domains, namely ski, beach, and city center, DiSCo summaries were rated as more detailed and useful for decision making than baseline large language model summaries, although slightly harder to read.

However, this paper argues that deterministic inference kills the ability to model uncertainty, makes emergent abilities vanish, disrupts reasoning abilities, and renders safety alignment brittle. Instead, the authors advocate for Stochastic CHAOS and claim that distributional variability is the heart of artificial cognition.

We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers.

ARM improves existing merging methods from static natural language tasks to multi-turn agent scenarios, and over the generalization ability across various interactive environments. This is achieved with a well-designed 3-step framework: 1) constructing merged backbones, 2) selection based on its role-conditioned activation analysis, and 3) neuron transplantation for fine-grained refinements. Without gradient-based optimization, ARM improves cross-benchmark generalization while enjoying efficiency. Across diverse domains, the model obtained via ARM merging outperforms prior model merging methods and domain-specific expert models, while demonstrating strong out-of-domain generalization.",28.58,11.65,333,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

This lack of transparency hinders users' ability to understand, validate and trust model behavior, particularly in high-risk applications. Although explainable AI (XAI) has made significant progress, there remains a need for versatile and effective techniques to address increasingly complex models. This work introduces Multivariate Conditional Expectation (MUCE), a model-agnostic method for local explainability designed to capture prediction changes from feature interactions. MUCE extends Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by exploring a multivariate grid of values in the neighborhood of a given observation at inference time, providing graphical explanations that illustrate the local evolution of model predictions. In addition, two quantitative indices, stability and uncertainty, summarize local behavior and assess model reliability. Uncertainty is further decomposed into uncertainty + and uncertainty − to capture asymmetric effects that global measures may overlook. The proposed method is validated using XGBoost models trained on three datasets: two synthetic (2D and 3D) to evaluate behavior near decision boundaries, and one transformed real-world dataset to test adaptability to heterogeneous feature types. Results show that MUCE effectively captures complex local model behavior, while the stability and uncertainty indices provide meaningful insight into prediction confidence. MUCE, together with the ICE modification and the proposed indices, offers a practical contribution to local explainability, enabling both graphical and quantitative insights that enhance the interpretability of predictive models and support more trustworthy and transparent decision-making.",28.91,15.254,441,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

However, the practical application of PPO is hindered by unreliable advantage estimation in the sparse-reward RLVR regime. This issue arises because the sparse rewards in RLVR lead to inaccurate intermediate value predictions, which in turn introduce significant bias when aggregated at every token by Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). To address this, we introduce Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE), which mitigates the bias that GAE can incur in RLVR. Our key insight is that aggregating n-step advantages at every token (as in GAE) is unnecessary and often introduces excessive bias, since individual tokens carry minimal information. Instead, SAE first partitions the generated sequence into coherent sub-segments using low-probability tokens as heuristic boundaries. It then selectively computes variance-reduced advantage estimates only from these information-rich segment transitions, effectively filtering out noise from intermediate tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that SAE achieves superior performance, with marked improvements in final scores, training stability, and sample efficiency. These gains are shown to be consistent across multiple model sizes, and a correlation analysis confirms that our proposed advantage estimator achieves a higher correlation with an approximate ground-truth advantage, justifying its superior performance.",28.66,15.701,450,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

To address this issue, we propose DualPD, a dual-perspective decoding refinement strategy that enhances the model's visual understanding without any additional training. DualPD consists of two components: (1) the layer-wise attention-guided contrastive logits module captures how the model's belief in the correct answer evolves by comparing output logits between layers that exhibit the largest attention shift.

To address this, we introduce conditional memory as a complementary sparsity axis, instantiated via Engram, a module that modernizes classic N-gram embedding for O(1) lookup. By formulating the Sparsity Allocation problem, we uncover a U-shaped scaling law that optimizes the trade-off between neural computation (MoE) and static memory (Engram). Guided by this law, we scale Engram to 27B parameters, achieving superior performance over a strictly iso-parameter and iso-FLOPs MoE baseline. Most notably, while the memory module is expected to aid knowledge retrieval (e.g., MMLU +3.4; CMMLU +4.0), we observe even larger gains in general reasoning (e.g., BBH +5.0; ARC-Challenge +3.7) and code/math domains (HumanEval +3.0; MATH +2.4). Mechanistic analyses reveal that Engram relieves the backbone’s early layers from static reconstruction, effectively deepening the network for complex reasoning. Furthermore, by delegating local dependencies to lookups, it frees up attention capacity for global context, substantially boosting long-context retrieval (e.g., Multi-Query NIAH:84.2 → 97.0). Finally, Engram establishes infrastructure-aware efficiency: its deterministic addressing enables runtime prefetching from host memory, incurring negligible overhead. We envision conditional memory as an indispensable modeling primitive for next-generation sparse models.

However, extant research has primarily emphasized improvements in accuracy metrics, while neglecting to address critical system-level considerations such as energy consumption and inference latency. Consequently, model designs have evolved to become increasingly intricate. To improve deployability, previous studies have investigated model compression and acceleration, yet these approaches are often pursued independently on either the software or hardware side. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally eliminate intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads. Hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and bit-width. Consequently, the benefits of such optimizations are often substantially diminished in real-world deployment. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a reusable software–hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework integrates software-level model optimizations with hardware-level computation optimizations under a unified system-level objective. Furthermore, a multidimensional evaluation metric, EERA V, is introduced. This metric evaluates the ME2E autonomous driving system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency and energy, enabling quantitative assessment of the true system-level impact of different optimization strategies. The proposed framework is evaluated across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks. It preserves baseline-level accuracy while reducing inference latency by over 6× and per-frame energy to around one-fifth of the baseline.

However, integrating external tools expands the attack surface, exposing agents to tool poisoning attacks. In such attacks, malicious instructions embedded in tool metadata are injected into the agent context during MCP registration phase, thereby manipulating agent behavior. Prior work primarily focuses on explicit tool poisoning or relied on manually crafted poisoned tools. In contrast, we focus on a stealthy variant: implicit tool poisoning, where the poisoned tool itself remains uninvoked. Instead, the instructions embedded in the tool metadata induce the agent to invoke a legitimate but high-privilege tool to perform malicious operations. We propose MCP-ITP, the first automated and adaptive framework for implicit tool poisoning within the MCP ecosystem.

RLPO first produces calibrated pointwise scores and item representations, then applies a lightweight encoder over the representations to predict listwise score residuals, avoiding full token-level listwise processing. We also introduce a large-scale benchmark for long-context review ranking with human verification. Experiments show RLPO improves NDCG@k over strong pointwise and listwise baselines and remains robust as list length increases.",27.55,10.491,289,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Existing methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, leading to overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize. Model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model. However, accurately estimating transitions and reward functions in multi-agent systems is challenging. This paper proposes a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions to infer global state dynamics, improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. The trained world model generates synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. An uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism is introduced to adaptively weight synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. The approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.

While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can enhance LLM reasoning abilities to some extent, they often suffer from a lack of faithfulness, where the derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches to bolster LLM logical reasoning capabilities. However, existing neuro-symbolic methods still face challenges with information loss during the process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS), a novel prompt-based method that employs a multi-round feedback mechanism to address LLM limitations in handling complex logical relationships. IFDNS utilizes iterative feedback during the logic extraction phase to accurately extract causal relationship statements and translate them into propositional and logical implication expressions, effectively mitigating information loss issues. Furthermore, IFDNS is orthogonal to existing prompt methods, allowing for seamless integration with various prompting approaches. Empirical evaluations across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IFDNS in significantly improving the performance of CoT and Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC).

To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query’s temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation.

To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics.

However, planning remains a primary bottleneck for reliable task execution. Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents.",28.0,13.355,374,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Although RL yields stronger final designs, modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle-matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, the authors explore pairing LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. The experiments suggest that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners, capable of designing and orchestrating RL-based optimization studies, defining search strategies, and coordinating multiple interacting components within a unified workflow.

To address this, we introduce Proof of Time (PoT), a semi-verifiable benchmarking framework that links scientific idea judgments to downstream signals that become observable later, such as citations and shifts in researchers' agendas. PoT freezes a pre-cutoff snapshot of evidence in an offline sandbox and asks models to forecast post-cutoff outcomes, enabling verifiable evaluation when ground truth arrives, scalable benchmarking without exhaustive expert annotation, and analysis of human–model misalignment against signals such as peer-review awards. In addition, PoT provides a controlled testbed for agent-based research judgments that evaluate scientific ideas, comparing tool-using agents to non-agent baselines under prompt ablations and budget scaling. Across 30K+ instances spanning four benchmark domains, we find that, compared with non-agent baselines, higher interaction budgets generally improve agentic performance, while the benefit of tool use is strongly task dependent. By combining time-partitioned, future-verifiable targets with an offline sandbox for tool use, PoT supports scalable evaluation of agents on future-facing scientific idea judgment tasks.",28.3,13.394,379,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Prior methods implicitly assume identified weaknesses are valid, ignoring reviewer bias, misunderstanding, and the critical role of author rebuttals in validating review quality. Most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The Customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise. The Rebuttal module introduces author agents that engage in structured debate with reviewer agents to validate and refine proposed weaknesses. The Prioritizer module learns from large-scale human review practices to assess the severity of validated weaknesses and surfaces the top-K severest ones to users.

This difficulty stems from several reasons: human motion is highly variable between individuals, viewpoints, and contexts; actions often exhibit complex spatial–temporal dynamics; and subtle differences between classes can be difficult to distinguish, while variations within the same action may be substantial. Despite these challenges, robust action recognition holds significant practical value, with applications in video surveillance, smart environments, human–computer interaction, sports analytics, and others. In recent years, 3D skeleton inputs have become particularly attractive for this task because they capture motion dynamics in a compact and semantically meaningful form, while being largely invariant to nuisance factors such as lighting, background clutter, and viewpoint changes. Although supervised skeleton-based methods achieve high recognition accuracy, they rely on large labeled datasets, which limit scalability in real-world scenarios where sample sizes are limited. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling the learning of structured and semantically meaningful representations that generalize across different datasets and supervision levels. This paper proposes a variational contrastive learning framework that integrates probabilistic latent modeling with contrastive self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on three widely used skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks show that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches, particularly in low-label regimes. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that the features provided by our method are more relevant given the motion and sample characteristics, with more focus on important skeleton joints, when compared to the other methods.",28.74,13.603,391,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Among numerous works that have been proposed in recent years, layer-wise token pruning approaches, which select a subset of tokens at particular layers to retain in KV cache and prune others, are one of the most popular schemes. However, such design is inflexible in the sense that the accuracy significantly varies across tasks and deteriorates in harder tasks such as KV retrieval. In this paper, we propose ASL, a training-free method that adaptively chooses the selection layer for KV cache reduction, exploiting the variance of token ranks ordered by attention score. The proposed method balances the performance across different tasks while meeting the user-specified KV budget requirement. ASL operates during the prefilling stage and can be jointly used with existing KV cache reduction methods such as SnapKV to optimize the decoding stage. By evaluations on the InfiniteBench, RULER, and NIAH benchmarks, we show that equipped with one-shot token selection, where tokens are selected at a layer and propagated to deeper layers, ASL outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise token selection methods in accuracy while maintaining decoding speed and KV cache reduction.

To systematically study this phenomenon, an automated data generation pipeline and a dataset containing 3,757 code-oriented test cases spanning 21 meta-scenarios, four programming languages, and varying contextual complexities were developed. The study on six LLMs reveals that emoticon semantic confusion is pervasive, with an average confusion ratio exceeding 38%.

While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {−1,0,+1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. Notably, on an Intel i7-14700HX CPU, our 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines while providing 25% bit savings and 10% speed up.

Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead.

Despite their apparent simplicity, these constraints fail with striking regularity, and the conditions governing failure have remained poorly understood. This paper presents the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation of negative instruction failure. It introduces semantic pressure, a quantitative measure of the model's intrinsic probability of generating the forbidden token, and demonstrates that violation probability follows a tight logistic relationship with pressure (p=σ(−2.40 + 2.27·P 0); n= 40,000 samples; bootstrap 95% CI for slope: [2.21,2.33]). Through layer-wise analysis using the logit lens technique, it establishes that the suppression signal induced by negative instructions is present but systematically weaker in failures: the instruction reduces target probability by only 5.2 percentage points in failures versus 22.8 points in successes—a 4.4× asymmetry. It traces this asymmetry to two mechanistically distinct failure modes: priming failure (87.5% of violations) and override failure (12.5%). In priming failure, the instruction's explicit mention of the forbidden word paradoxically activates rather than suppresses the target representation. In override failure, late-layer feed-forward networks generate contributions of +0.39 toward the target probability—nearly 4× larger than in successes—overwhelming earlier suppression signals. Activation patching confirms that layers 23–27 are causally responsible: replacing these layers' activations flips the sign of constraint effects. These findings reveal a fundamental tension in negative constraint design: the very act of naming a forbidden word primes the model to produce it.",29.05,14.906,433,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

To address these challenges, we propose Q-realign, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure. By reframing quantization as a dual-objective procedure for compression and safety, Q-realign decouples safety alignment from fine-tuning and naturally piggybacks into modern deployment pipelines.

In the Defect Turbulence regime, system dynamics are governed by topological phase singularities (spiral waves) whose motion couples to manifold curvature via geometric pinning. Conventional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using ReLU or Tanh activations suffer from fundamental spectral bias, failing to resolve high-frequency gradients and causing amplitude collapse or phase drift. We propose a Multi-Scale SIREN-PINN architecture leveraging periodic sinusoidal activations with frequency-diverse initialization, embedding the appropriate inductive bias for wave-like physics directly into the network structure. This enables simultaneous resolution of macroscopic wave envelopes and microscopic defect cores. Validated on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation evolving on latent Riemannian manifolds, our architecture achieves relative state prediction error ϵL2 ≈1.92×10−2, outperforming standard baselines by an order of magnitude while preserving topological invariants (|∆Ndefects|<1). We solve the ill-posed inverse pinning problem, reconstructing hidden Gaussian curvature fields solely from partial observations of chaotic wave dynamics (Pearson correlation ρ=0.965).

However, it often struggles with long-horizon tasks involving sparse rewards. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL, an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.",28.4,13.626,387,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

We introduce a novel collaborative framework, Stepping Stone Plus (SSP), which integrates optical flow and textual prompts to assist the segmentation process. In scenarios where sound sources frequently coexist with moving objects, our pre-mask technique leverages optical flow to capture motion dynamics, providing essential temporal context for precise segmentation. To address the challenge posed by stationary sound-emitting objects, such as alarm clocks, SSP incorporates two specific textual prompts: one identifies the category of the sound-emitting object, and the other provides a broader description of the scene. Additionally, we implement a visual-textual alignment module (VTA) to facilitate cross-modal integration, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant semantic interpretations.

Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a predominant strategy to adapt VLMs to unlabeled test data on the fly. However, existing TTA methods heavily rely on zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels for self-training, which can be unreliable under distribution shifts and misguide adaptation due to two fundamental limitations. First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose SubTTA, which aligns the semantic subspaces of both modalities to enhance zero-shot predictions to better guide the TTA process. To bridge the modality gap, SubTTA extracts the principal subspaces of both modalities and aligns the visual manifold to the textual semantic anchor by minimizing their chordal distance. To eliminate visual nuisance, SubTTA projects the aligned visual features onto the task-specific textual subspace, which filters out task-irrelevant noise by constraining visual embeddings within the valid semantic span, and standard TTA is further performed on the purified space to refine the decision boundaries.

However, there is no consensus on how best to construct and utilize such profiles. To address this, we revisit recent profiling-based approaches in recommender systems along four dimensions: 1) knowledge base, 2) preference indicator, 3) impact range, and 4) subject. We argue that large language models (LLMs) are effective at extracting compressed rationales from diverse knowledge sources, while knowledge graphs (KGs) are better suited for propagating these profiles to extend their reach. Building on this insight, we propose a new recommendation model, called SPiKE. SPiKE consists of three core components: i) Entity profile generation, which uses LLMs to generate semantic profiles for all KG entities; ii) Profile-aware KG aggregation, which integrates these profiles into the KG; and iii) Pairwise profile preference matching, which aligns LLM- and KG-based representations during training.

We propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily.

Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes. Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across LLMs of varying sizes and families demonstrate that HS2C simultaneously enhances the compression rate and downstream inference accuracy, validating its superiority and scalability.

Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs.

Existing SD methods tailored for video-LLMs primarily focus on pruning redundant visual tokens to mitigate the computational burden of massive visual inputs. However, existing methods do not achieve inference acceleration comparable to text-only LLMs. We observe from extensive experiments that this phenomenon mainly stems from two limitations: (i) their pruning strategies inadequately preserve visual semantic tokens, degrading draft quality and acceptance rates; (ii) even with aggressive pruning (e.g., 90% visual tokens removed), the draft model’s remaining inference cost limits overall speedup. To address these limitations, we propose HIPPO, a holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework. Specifically, HIPPO proposes (i) a semantic-aware token preservation method, which fuses global attention scores with local visual semantics to retain semantic information at high pruning ratios; (ii) a video parallel SD algorithm that decouples and overlaps draft generation and target verification phases. Experiments on four video-LLMs across six benchmarks demonstrate HIPPO’s effectiveness, yielding up to 3.51× speedup compared to vanilla auto-regressive decoding.",28.04,12.734,357,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Despite this scale, empirical evidence suggests that only a small subset of actions meaningfully influences performance in a given deployment. Motivated by this observation, we study a contextual linear reward model in which action relevance is governed by a structured sparsity assumption: only a small number of actions have nonzero effects across latent states. We formulate action discovery as a block-sparse recovery problem and analyze a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Under standard assumptions on incoherence, signal strength, and action coverage, we prove that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability, using a number of samples that scales polynomially in the sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in the total number of actions. We further provide estimation error guarantees for refitted parameters and show that the resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states. Complementing these results, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds demonstrating that sparsity and sufficient coverage are necessary for tractability.

This paper proposes a novel GAN structural model, termed the Inception Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN), that incorporates deeper inception-inspired convolution and dilated convolution. The IGAN model generates high-quality synthetic images while maintaining training stability by reducing mode collapse and preventing vanishing and exploding gradients. Our proposed IGAN model achieves a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.12 and 15.08 on the CUB-200 and ImageNet datasets, respectively, representing a 28-33% improvement in FID over the state-of-the-art GANs. Additionally, the IGAN model attains an Inception Score (IS) of 9.27 and 68.25, reflecting improved image diversity and generation quality.

However, a notable contradiction exists between the high resource consumption of large models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated. These are combined with a weighted cross-entropy loss using hard labels to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to the smaller student model. Finally, through prompt tuning engineering optimized for the UAV control scenario, the model's performance on core tasks such as SDK type recognition and function call matching is enhanced. Experimental results indicate that the distilled lightweight model (parameters ≤ 1B) maintains high code generation accuracy while achieving significant improvements in deployment and inference efficiency, effectively demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of our approach in achieving precise and lightweight intelligent control for UAVs.",28.77,14.39,414,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Recent work on Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO) shows that dense steering vectors can be learned directly from preference data in a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fashion, enabling control over truthfulness, hallucinations, and safety behaviors. However, dense steering vectors often entangle multiple latent factors due to neuron multi-semanticity, limiting their effectiveness and stability in fine-grained settings such as cultural alignment, where closely related values and behaviors must be distinguished. In this paper, we propose Y aPO, a reference-free method that learns sparse steering vectors in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). By optimizing sparse codes, Y aPO produces disentangled, interpretable, and efficient steering directions. Empirically, we show that Y aPO converges faster, achieves stronger performance, and exhibits improved training stability compared to dense steering baselines. Beyond cultural alignment, Y aPO generalizes to a range of alignment-related behaviors, including hallucination, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, and power-seeking. Importantly, Y aPO preserves general knowledge, with no measurable degradation on MMLU.

However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions.

This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to address these challenges by jointly optimizing charging schedules and trip assignments for mixed (electric and diesel bus) fleets while considering factors such as dynamic electricity pricing, vehicle capacity, and route constraints.

However, manually writing high-performance pragmas remains a significant challenge, requiring expertise in memory hierarchies, data movement, and parallelization strategies. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. This work presents a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without prohibitive computational costs associated with LLM post-training. The GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework is leveraged to iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop, using crossover and mutation of prompt instructions guided by expertly curated 'gold' pragma examples and structured feedback based on clause and parameter-level mismatches between 'gold' pragma and predicted pragma. Evaluation on the PolyBench suite shows a significant increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragmas generated using optimized prompts compared to those annotated with simpler initial prompts, particularly for smaller and cheaper 'nano'-scale models. The optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs achieving functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines. These results demonstrate that prompt optimization effectively unlocks the potential of smaller, cheaper LLMs to write stable and effective GPU-offloading directives, establishing a cost-effective pathway and lowering the expertise barrier to automated directive-based parallelization in HPC development workflows.",28.63,14.215,407,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling windows schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias.

An emerging and critical challenge is how to identify conceptually relevant prior work from rapidly growing literature, and assess how a new idea differentiates from existing research. Current embedding approaches typically conflate distinct conceptual aspects into single representations and cannot support fine-grained literature retrieval; meanwhile, LLM-based evaluators are subject to sycophancy biases, failing to provide discriminative novelty assessment. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Ideation Space, a structured representation that decomposes scientific knowledge into three distinct dimensions: research problem, methodology, and core findings, each learned through contrastive training. This framework enables principled measurement of conceptual distance between ideas and modeling of ideation transitions that capture logical connections within a proposed idea. Building upon this representation, we propose a Hierarchical Sub-Space Retrieval framework for efficient, targeted literature retrieval and a Decomposed Novelty Assessment algorithm that identifies which aspects of an idea are novel. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements, where our approach achieves Recall@30 of 0.329 (16.7% over baselines), our ideation transition retrieval reaches Hit Rate@30 of 0.643, and novelty assessment attains 0.37 correlation with expert judgments.

Recent research suggests that parameter-sharing transformers can bridge this gap by forming a 'Generalization Circuit' during a prolonged 'grokking' phase. A fundamental question arises: Is a grokked model superior to its non-grokked counterparts on downstream tasks? Furthermore, is the extensive computational cost of waiting for the grokking phase worthwhile? In this work, we conduct a mechanistic study to evaluate the Generalization Circuit's role in knowledge assimilation and transfer. We demonstrate that: (i) The inference paths established by non-grokked and grokked models for in-distribution compositional queries are identical. This suggests that the 'Generalization Circuit' does not represent the sudden acquisition of a new reasoning paradigm. Instead, we argue that grokking is the process of integrating memorized atomic facts into a naturally established reasoning path. (ii) Achieving high accuracy on unseen cases after prolonged training and the formation of a certain reasoning path are not bound; they can occur independently under specific data regimes. (iii) Even a mature circuit exhibits limited transferability when integrating new knowledge, suggesting that 'grokked' Transformers do not achieve a full mastery of compositional logic.

HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process.

Chen2, Wenya Wang1",,,"multi-constraint planning, efficient planning, robustness, code-based planning, external solvers, reusable execution abstractions","Multi-constraint planning involves identifying, evaluating, and refining candidate plans while satisfying multiple, potentially conflicting constraints. Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the ScalableCOdePlanning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by 4.67x. Code is available at https://github.com/DerrickGXD/SCOPE. To address these issues, prior work has explored integrating external solvers into the reasoning process, leveraging their reliability and determinism to enforce constraints and verify solutions. Subsequent efforts have aimed to handle diverse constraints in planning, but existing methods either perform similar reasoning in natural language or generate similar solver code for each query, resulting in high computational cost and lack of reusable execution abstractions. Nevertheless, existing code-based methods lack a systematic mechanism to capture the underlying logic of planning tasks, leading to challenges in robustness and scalability.",28.84,16.436,474,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., “bad,” “neutral,” “good”). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher’s ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the Deep-Mind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.",28.43,13.016,370,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions.

This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment.

To address this challenge, FairGE (Fair Graph Encoding) is introduced as a fairness-aware framework for GTs in incomplete social networks. Instead of generating sensitive attributes, FairGE encodes fairness directly through spectral graph theory.

Across layers and modules, we find that ability-related activations are highly concentrated in a small set of channels (typically <5%), and these channels are largely disentangled with good sufficiency and stability. Building on these observations, we propose ACT (Activation-Guided Channel-wise Ability Transfer), which localizes ability-relevant channels via activation differences and selectively transfers only the corresponding parameters, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for compatibility.

However, smaller LMs often struggle with this translation task, frequently producing incorrect symbolic outputs due to formatting and translation errors. Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance.

Yet, even securely trained models are vulnerable to inference attacks aiming to extract memorized data from model outputs. To ensure output privacy and mitigate inference attacks, differential privacy (DP) injects calibrated noise during training. While cryptography and DP offer complementary guarantees, combining them efficiently for cryptographic and differentially private CL (CPCL) is challenging.

To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory mechanisms cannot effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms.",27.86,11.738,327,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale Optimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized.

To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyzes, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options.

Existing methods achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics. Recent work shows that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation, with structured pruning methods experiencing near-total collapse in factual question-answering capabilities. We introduce agent-guided pruning, where a foundation model acts as an adaptive pruning agent to intelligently select which layers to prune at each iteration while preserving critical knowledge pathways. Our method constructs layer-wise sensitivity profiles by combining Wanda-inspired weight-activation metrics with gradient importance scores, normalized as z-scores for model-agnostic comparison. These statistics are processed by an LLM agent equipped with self-reflection capabilities, enabling it to learn from previous pruning outcomes and iteratively refine its strategy. A checkpoint rollback mechanism maintains model quality by reverting when perplexity degradation exceeds a threshold. We evaluate our approach on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B parameters) at approximately 45% sparsity, demonstrating substantial improvements over structured pruning baselines: 56% relative improvement in MMLU accuracy, 19×better factual knowledge retention on FreebaseQA, and 69% lower perplexity degradation. Notably, our framework requires no retraining, operates in a model-agnostic manner, and exhibits effective self-correction with only 2-4 rollbacks across 21-40 iterations, demonstrating that foundation models can effectively guide the compression of other foundation models.",29.16,14.37,419,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations—such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench—a corpus of validated ⟨original code, simplified code⟩ pairs with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.",28.58,13.893,397,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

We introduce a value-aware numerical representation that augments standard tokenized inputs with a dedicated prefix token whose embedding is explicitly conditioned on the underlying numerical value. This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures. Evaluation on arithmetic tasks shows that the proposed approach outperforms baselines across numerical formats, tasks, and operand lengths.

Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms often do not fully address this duality, assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, drastically outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20.

Responses from state-of-the-art LLMs were systematically compared to those from clinicians. The analysis revealed that LLMs often fail to redirect problematic questions, even when the problematic premise is detected, and provide answers that could lead to suboptimal medical decision-making. The findings highlight a substantial gap in LLM performance under real-world health communication conditions, emphasizing critical safety concerns for patient-facing medical AI systems.

Since its introduction in the human–AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human–AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs—patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.",28.66,15.386,441,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan.

A pipeline using large language models was developed to generate the first synthetic dataset of how older adults request tech support (OATS). The study identified four key communication challenges: verbosity, incompleteness, over-specification, and under-specification. The prompt-chaining approach using GPT-4o significantly improved solution accuracy and Google search results. Younger adults better understood AI-rephrased queries, while older adults reported high perceived ability to answer contextual questions and follow solutions.

Beyond language competence, researchers are exploring whether LLMs can exhibit human-like characteristics that influence engagement, decision-making, and perceived realism. Personality, in particular, is critical, yet existing approaches often struggle to achieve both nuanced and adaptable expression. We present a framework that models LLM personality via Jungian psychological types, integrating three mechanisms: a dominant–auxiliary coordination mechanism for coherent core expression, a reinforcement–compensation mechanism for temporary adaptation to context, and a reflection mechanism that drives long-term personality evolution. This design allows the agent to maintain nuanced traits while dynamically adjusting to interaction demands and gradually updating its underlying structure. Personality alignment is evaluated using Myers–Briggs Type Indicator questionnaires and tested under diverse challenge scenarios as a preliminary structured assessment. Findings suggest that evolving, personality-aware LLMs can support coherent, context-sensitive interactions, enabling naturalistic agent design in HCI.",27.77,11.416,317,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

To address this limitation, we propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike static workflows, PaperScout dynamically decides whether, when, and how to invoke search and expand tools based on accumulated retrieval context. However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks—where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions—leading to noisy credit assignment and unstable training dynamics. We introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO), a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent–environment interaction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance, validating the effectiveness of our adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.",27.97,12.299,344,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across Multi-Fidelity (MF) data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data.

The budgeted-sufficiency objective yields small, spatially compact evidence sets without sacrificing baseline performance.

The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. The LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions and attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan thus becomes a verifiable artifact and execution becomes more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer.

Theoretical guarantees are provided for asymptotic identifiability of four pairwise relations. On data-free benchmarks derived from Mooij et al. and UCI causal graphs, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet–weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions. Tree-Query thus offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

However, it can substantially degrade safety alignment, especially when fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Existing methods struggle with a safety-utility dilemma, as emphasizing safety compromises task performance, and prioritizing utility often requires deep fine-tuning that leads to safety decline. This work addresses this dilemma by shedding light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space, and these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning. SPF, a lightweight approach, explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace, ensuring utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. SPF also exhibits robust resistance to deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks.

The core idea of ReasAlign is to incorporate structured reasoning steps to analyze user queries, detect conflicting instructions, and preserve the continuity of the user’s intended tasks to defend against indirect injection attacks. To further ensure reasoning logic and accuracy, we introduce a test-time scaling mechanism with a preference-optimized judge model that scores reasoning steps and selects the best trajectory.

We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology.

Historically, optimization methods have been categorized by the degree to which they exploit derivative information. First-order methods rely exclusively on gradient evaluations, whereas (approximate) second-order methods incorporate curvature information via Hessians or suitable approximations. However, the massive scale of modern ML problems, combined with the principles of empirical risk minimization, has driven the field toward stochastic optimization. Stochastic optimization methods, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants, employ inexpensive noisy gradient evaluations that scale efficiently with data size. Consequently, much of modern ML focuses on integrating first-order schemes, adaptive gradient methods, and curvature-aware techniques into stochastic optimization frameworks. This familiar optimization landscape changes substantially in the context of scientific machine learning (SciML). Unlike classical ML, where abundant data allows stochastic approximation to perform well, SciML often operates in data-scarce regimes in which physical models must supplement, or even dominate, the available data. As a result, the optimization problems arising in SciML frequently take the form of physics informed or operator constrained formulations, in which the objective function incorporates a partial-differential equation (PDE) and boundary or initial conditions (BC or IC). These components change the structure of the objective function, since the loss depends on differential operators and induces global spatio-temporal coupling. This difference has profound implications. In classical ML, the loss function typically decomposes into independent sample contributions, which enables efficient stochastic optimization. In contrast, SciML losses are often non-convex and non-smooth, making them challenging to optimize. The optimization problems in SciML often require specialized techniques, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), to handle the physics constraints and data scarcity. As a result, the optimization landscape in SciML is more complex and requires a deeper understanding of both optimization methods and the specific challenges posed by scientific machine learning problems.",29.51,17.588,519,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

This report investigates whether Looped Transformers (LTs), which increase computational depth by iterating shared layers, can bridge this gap by utilizing their iterative nature as a form of introspection. Experiments reveal that while increasing loop iterations narrows the gap, it is partly driven by a degradation of their internal 'knowledge' carried by representations.

Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks) routes only critical steps to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level, using process reward models to identify erroneous steps and make routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. Several routing strategies are developed within TRIM, ranging from simple threshold-based policies to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5× higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6× higher cost efficiency.

To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective, utilizing the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. We propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue.

MAMoE simultaneously enhances modality-specific learning and cross-modal understanding through two complementary components: modality-specific expert groups that capture domain-specific patterns and shared experts that facilitate information transfer between modalities. Building on this architecture, we develop an efficient transformation pipeline that adapts the pretrained MoE language model through strategic post-training on ASR and TTS datasets, followed by fine-tuning with a carefully curated speech-text instruction dataset. A key feature of this pipeline is that it relies exclusively on fully accessible, open-source datasets to achieve strong performance and data efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks show that MoST consistently outperforms existing models of comparable parameter counts.

Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an M/G/1 queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime.

We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck.

Test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, but existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.",27.94,12.847,359,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Existing tasks to enrich DKGs rely primarily on extracting knowledge from unstructured data or completing KGs through internal reasoning, but the scope and quality of such integration remain limited. This highlights a critical gap: little systematic exploration has been conducted on how comprehensive, high-quality GKGs can be effectively leveraged to supplement DKGs. To address this gap, we propose a new and practical task: domain-specific knowledge graph fusion (DKGF), which aims to mine and integrate relevant facts from general knowledge graphs into domain-specific knowledge graphs to enhance their completeness and utility. Unlike previous research, this new task faces two key challenges: high ambiguity of domain relevance and cross-domain knowledge granularity misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose ExeFuse, a simple yet effective Fact-as-Program paradigm that reformulates DKGF as executable semantic reasoning over DKGs. By unifying relevance assessment and granularity transformation within a single probabilistic framework, ExeFuse enables precise identification and integration of domain-relevant, consistent knowledge from GKGs.

They stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion and likelihood-based scoring metrics. The findings indicate that most examples have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. Likelihood scoring metrics consistently prefer the fixed code, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes, while metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant is seen.

Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition.

The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organizing multi-granular spans and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It explicitly constrains diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, better covers secondary facets, and has better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies show that both structural priors and diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.",27.83,10.026,279,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventions Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual.

Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation.

Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, it is observed that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes.

We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. This method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation.

We then formulate a contextual DRO model with a CSD-based ambiguity set, termed Causal Sinkhorn DRO (Causal-SDRO), and derive its strong dual reformulation where the worst-case distribution is characterized as a mixture of Gibbs distributions. To solve the corresponding infinite-dimensional policy optimization, we propose the Soft Regression Forest (SRF) decision rule, which approximates optimal policies within arbitrary measurable function spaces. The SRF preserves the interpretability of classical decision trees while being fully parametric, differentiable, and Lipschitz smooth, enabling intrinsic interpretation from both global and local perspectives. To solve the Causal-SDRO with parametric decision rules, we develop an efficient stochastic compositional gradient algorithm that converges to anε-stationary point at a rate of O(ε−4), matching the convergence rate of standard stochastic gradient descent.

Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.

However, most practical agents remain human-designed due to the wide variation in tasks, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection, a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits, and hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns.

To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: inter-community filtering, community-level refinement, and entity-level fine-grained search. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO). This novel reinforcement learning approach dynamically adjusts reward weights to balance relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness.

Central to this approach is the governance graph, a public, immutable manifest that declares legal states, transitions, sanctions, and restorative paths. An Oracle/Controller runtime interprets this manifest, attaching enforceable consequences to evidence of coordination while recording a cryptographically keyed, append-only governance log for audit and provenance. The framework is applied to govern the Cournot collusion case documented by prior work, comparing three regimes: Ungoverned (baseline incentives from the structure of the Cournot market), Constitutional (a prompt-only policy-as-prompt prohibition implemented as a fixed written anti-collusion constitution), and Institutional (governance-graph-based). Across six model configurations including cross-provider pairs (N=90 runs/condition), the Institutional regime produces large reductions in collusion: mean tier falls from 3.1 to 1.8 (Cohen’s d=1.28), and severe-collusion incidence drops from 50% to 5.6%.

We propose a framework to evaluate an LLM’s decision logic in recruitment by drawing on established economic methodologies for analyzing human hiring behavior. We build synthetic datasets from real freelancer profiles and project descriptions from a major European online freelance marketplace and apply a full factorial design to estimate how a LLM weighs different match-relevant criteria when evaluating freelancer-project fit.

This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyper-parameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.

In practice, only sparse point labels are typically available, and existing deep learning-based models struggle under such weak supervision. Meanwhile, wetlands exhibit strong seasonal and inter-annual dynamics, making single-date imagery insufficient and causing substantial omission and commission errors when mapping. Although powerful foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide promising generalization from point prompts, it is intrinsically designed for static natural images, resulting in spatially fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetland environments and cannot exploit satellite image time series. To address these challenges, we propose WetSAM, a novel SAM-based framework that effectively leverages satellite image time series to enhance wetland mapping from sparse point annotations. WetSAM adopts a dual-branch design: (1) The temporal branch is prompted by sparse point labels to extend the SAM with a hierarchical adapter and a dynamic temporal aggregation module. By decomposing time series into seasonal trends and transient events, this branch effectively distinguishes wetland features from phenological variations; (2) The spatial branch reconstructs distinct boundaries via a temporal-constrained region-growing strategy, iteratively expanding sparse points into reliable dense pseudo-labels; (3) A bidirectional consistency regularization enforces minimizing the discrepancy of the predictions from two segmentation heads of two branches. We validate the effectiveness of WetSAM across eight diverse global locations, each covering an area of around 5,000 km² and with various wetland types and geographical features. WetSAM reaches an average F1-score of 85.58%, considerably outperforming other state-of-the-art algorithms. Results demonstrate that WetSAM achieves accurate, structurally consistent segmentation from sparse labels. With minimal labeling effort, our framework shows strong generalization ability and holds promise for scalable, low-cost wetland mapping at high spatial resolutions.",28.98,18.493,536,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.",28.08,12.499,351,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism. The unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes.

This strategic release improves the releaser's welfare at the expense of their opponent and the regulator's fairness objectives. Our findings demonstrate that static regulatory frameworks are vulnerable to manipulation via technology expansion, necessitating dynamic market designs that adapt to the evolving landscape of AI capabilities.",28.0,10.643,298,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we develop a tokenization framework that segments Indonesian text at syllable boundaries before applying byte-pair encoding, creating a vocabulary that aligns with the language's morphophonological structure. Our approach first identifies high-frequency syllables through rule-based segmentation, then constructs a compact vocabulary of 3,500 tokens that preserves meaningful linguistic units while maintaining coverage through character-level fallback. Empirical evaluation on Indonesian Wikipedia and folklore corpora from Indonesian Culture Digital Library (PDBI) demonstrates substantial improvements over conventional tokenization methods: the syllable-based approach achieves R´enyi efficiency of 0.74 compared to 0.50-0.64 for pretrained multilingual tokenizers, while maintaining higher average token lengths (3.67 characters versus 2.72 for GPT-2) despite using a vocabulary an order of magnitude smaller. These gains emerge from the method's ability to internalize character-level dependencies within syllable units, reducing the computational burden on language models while respecting Indonesian's agglutinative morphology.

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.",28.45,13.882,395,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

For example, VLMs may associate minimalism with abstract designs, whereas designers emphasize shape and color choices. Our key insight is to leverage design data—a collection of real-world designs that implicitly captures designer’s principles—to learn design knowledge and guide stylistic improvement. We propose PRISM (Prior-Informed Stylistic Modification) that constructs and applies a design knowledge base through three stages: clustering high-variance designs to capture diversity within a style, summarizing each cluster into actionable design knowledge, and retrieving relevant knowledge during inference to enable style-aware improvement.

This paper introduces a fully self-reflective detoxification framework that harnesses the inherent capacities of LLMs to detect, correct toxic content, and refine LLMs without external modules and data annotation.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance.

This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation.

We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model–Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only O(log^2 T) times, where T is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks.

Existing single-LLM-based methods primarily reduce the context window or optimize the attention mechanism, but they often encounter additional computational costs or constrained expanded context length. While multi-agent-based frameworks can mitigate these limitations, they remain susceptible to the accumulation of errors and the propagation of hallucinations. In this work, we draw inspiration from the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to design a Multi-Agent System called LSTM-MAS, emulating LSTM's hierarchical information flow and gated memory mechanisms for long-context understanding. Specifically, LSTM-MAS organizes agents in a chained architecture, where each node comprises a worker agent for segment-level comprehension, a filter agent for redundancy reduction, a judge agent for continuous error detection, and a manager agent for globally regulating information propagation and retention, analogous to LSTM and its input gate, forget gate, constant error carousel unit, and output gate. These novel designs enable controlled information transfer and selective long-term dependency modeling across textual segments, which can effectively avoid error accumulation and hallucination propagation. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our method.

While LLMs are already achieving near-human accuracy on objective annotation tasks, their performance on subjective annotation tasks, such as those involving psychological constructs, is less consistent and more prone to errors. Standard evaluation practices typically collapse all annotation errors into a single alignment metric, but this simplified approach may obscure different kinds of errors that affect final analytical conclusions in different ways. Here, we propose a diagnostic evaluation paradigm that incorporates a human-in-the-loop step to separate task-inherent ambiguity from model-driven inaccuracies and assess annotation quality in terms of their potential downstream impacts. We refine this paradigm on ordinal annotation tasks, which are common in subjective annotation. The refined paradigm includes: (1) a diagnostic taxonomy that categorizes LLM annotation errors along two dimensions: source (model-specific vs. task-inherent) and type (boundary ambiguity vs. conceptual misidentification); (2) a lightweight human annotation test to estimate task-inherent ambiguity from LLM annotations; and (3) a computational method to decompose observed LLM annotation errors following our taxonomy. We validate this paradigm on four educational annotation tasks, demonstrating both its conceptual validity and practical utility. Theoretically, our work provides empirical evidence for why excessively high alignment is unrealistic in specific annotation tasks and why single alignment metrics inadequately reflect the quality of LLM annotations. In practice, our paradigm can be a low-cost diagnostic tool that assesses the suitability of a given task for LLM annotation and provides actionable insights for further technical optimization.",28.98,14.767,428,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

At inference time, TAAR truncates the trajectory before the predicted trap segment and adaptively restarts decoding; for severely trapped cases, it applies stronger perturbations, including higher-temperature resampling and an optional structured reboot suffix.

This design enables two key capabilities: (1) transforming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation.

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program.

He, David Parker",,2601.12003,"Robustquantitativeverification, Probabilisticmodelchecking, Concurrent stochastic games, Epistemic uncertainty","Autonomous and intelligent systems are increasingly deployed in environments that are nondeterministic, stochastic, and concurrent. Concurrent stochastic games (CSGs) provide a powerful framework for modeling such multi-agent systems. Unlike simpler models of turn-based stochastic games, CSGs allow players to select their actions simultaneously, without knowledge of each other's choices. The outcomes depend probabilistically on the players' joint actions. Formal verification techniques for CSGs provide a means to establish quantitative guarantees on the behavior of these stochastic multi-agent systems, e.g., ensuring that a drone can safely reach its target with at least 95% probability, regardless of the actions of other aircraft. They can also be used to automatically synthesise controllers or strategies that achieve these guarantees. We introduce robust CSGs and their subclass interval CSGs (ICSGs), which capture epistemic uncertainty about transition probabilities in CSGs. We propose an innovative framework for robust verification under worst-case assumptions about transition uncertainty. Specifically, we develop the underlying theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms for finite- and infinite-horizon objectives in both zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings, the latter based on (social-welfare optimal) Nash equilibria. We build an implementation in the PRISM-games model checker and demonstrate the feasibility of robust verification of ICSGs across a selection of large benchmarks.",28.57,12.356,353,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

While recent benchmarks have focused on evaluating the structural correctness of such outputs, the environmental impact of inference for different output formats has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we argue that structured output formats should be assessed not only in terms of correctness, but also with respect to their environmental efficiency. To this end, we introduce a sustainability-aware evaluation framework for structured generation that measures token usage, generation time, and estimated carbon emissions. Within this framework, we propose the Environment-Aware Generation Correctness Score (GCSenv), a unified metric that integrates structural correctness with carbon-aware efficiency. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark the novel TOON format against established representations (JSON, XML, YAML) across multiple LLMs spanning different architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal a consistent trade-off: TOON yields markedly more compact outputs and lower emissions, but lower structural correctness when models lack native support. We show that increased model capacity reduces this gap and that environment-aware scoring can shift format rankings depending on deployment priorities, highlighting the need for sustainability-inclusive benchmarking and providing empirical evidence that compact representations such as TOON can offer practical advantages in large-scale, carbon-conscious LLM deployments.",28.06,13.327,374,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for addressing this issue, their effectiveness is often hindered by Sycophancy, a tendency to produce reasoning that matches users’ beliefs over truthful ones, which deviates from instruction-following principles. This work proposes a novel approach that harnesses this behavior to generate contrastive reasoning from opposing perspectives. Specifically, we design a Self-renewal Opposing-stance Reasoning Generation (SORG) framework that prompts LLMs to produce high-quality “agree” and “disagree” reasoning pairs for a given news title without requiring ground-truth labels. To utilize the generated reasoning, we develop a local Opposing Reasoning-based Clickbait Detection (ORCD) model that integrates three BERT encoders to represent the title and its associated reasoning. The model leverages contrastive learning, guided by soft labels derived from LLM-generated credibility scores, to enhance detection robustness. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms LLM prompting, fine-tuned smaller language models, and state-of-the-art clickbait detection baselines.

However, this data is ultimately the product of human brains, the filtered projection of a deeper neural complexity. In this paper, we explore a new strategy for artificial intelligence: moving beyond surface-level statistical regularities by training foundation models directly on human brain data. We hypothesize that neuroimaging data could open a window into elements of human cognition that are not accessible through observable actions, and argue that this additional knowledge could be used, alongside classical training data, to overcome some of the current limitations of foundation models. While previous research has demonstrated the possibility to train classical machine learning or deep learning models on neural patterns, this path remains largely unexplored for high-level cognitive functions. Here, we classify the current limitations of foundation models, as well as the promising brain regions and cognitive processes that could be leveraged to address them, along four levels: perception, valuation, execution, and integration. Then, we propose two methods that could be implemented to prioritize the use of limited neuroimaging data for strategically chosen, high-value steps in foundation model training: reinforcement learning from human brain (RLHB) and chain of thought from human brain (CoTHB). We also discuss the potential implications for agents, artificial general intelligence, and artificial superintelligence, as well as the ethical, social, and technical challenges and opportunities. We argue that brain-trained foundation models could represent a realistic and effective middle ground between continuing to scale current architectures and exploring alternative, neuroscience-inspired solutions. We also note that future discoveries in cognitive and computational neuroscience could make this strategy increasingly relevant over time, as new neural signals of interest are retroactively unlocked in present neuroimaging datasets.",28.77,15.884,457,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals.",28.15,11.404,321,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

A naïve strategy is to either enlarge inputs or downsample the WSIs. However, enlarging inputs results in prohibitive GPU memory consumption, while downsampling alters the microns-per-pixel resolution and obscures critical morphological details. To overcome these limitations, we propose an space- and time- efficient inference strategy that sparsifies attention using spatially aware neighboring blocks and filters out non-informative tokens through global attention scores. This design substantially reduces GPU memory and runtime during high-resolution WSI inference while preserving and even improving the downstream performance, enabling inference at higher resolutions under the same GPU budget.

Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging addresses this challenge by reconstructing the scene from indirect measurements. Recently, passive NLOS methods that use an ordinary photograph of the subtle shadow cast onto a visible wall by the hidden scene have gained interest.

It works by retrieving knowledge and facts from external databases, augmenting the prompt with the retrieved data, and enabling the LLM to generate more accurate responses. In traditional architectures, RAG services are provided by a single entity that hosts the dataset and issues queries within a trusted local environment. However, individuals or small organizations often lack the resources to maintain data storage servers, leading them to rely on outsourced, cloud-based storage for scalability. This dependence on untrusted third-party services introduces significant privacy risks, particularly when handling private and sensitive data. Embedding-based retrieval mechanisms, commonly used in RAG systems, are especially vulnerable to privacy leakage such as vector-to-text reconstruction attacks and structural leakage via vector analysis. Several privacy-preserving RAG techniques have been proposed to address such vulnerabilities; however, most existing approaches rely on partially homomorphic encryption, which incurs substantial computational overhead and limits their practicality in real-world deployments. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving RAG framework (ppRAG) tailored for untrusted cloud environments that defends against vector-to-text attack, vector analysis, and query analysis. At its core, we propose Conditional Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption (CAPRISE) that encrypts embeddings while still allowing the cloud to compute similarity between an encrypted query embedding and the encrypted database embeddings. CAPRISE preserves only the relative distance ordering between the encrypted query and each encrypted database embedding, without exposing inter-database distances, thereby enhancing both privacy and efficiency. To further mitigate query analysis risks, we introduce differential privacy by perturbing the query embedding prior to encryption, preventing the cloud from inferring sensitive patterns from query frequency. Experimental results show that ppRAG achieves efficient processing throughput, high retrieval accuracy, strong privacy guarantees, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained users seeking secure, cloud-augmented LLMs.",28.82,17.59,507,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

In this emerging ecosystem, GUI agents serve as a new control plane mediating interactions across application boundaries. However, their design operates under the implicit assumption of Visual Atomicity: that the UI state remains invariant between observation and action. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally invalid in Android, creating a critical attack surface. We present Action Rebinding, a novel cross-application attack that allows a seemingly-benign application with zero dangerous permissions to rebind an agent's execution. By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target application. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize rebound states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected. We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 diverse tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal).

In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an 𝛼-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry.

However, high-noise audio inputs are prone to introducing adverse interference into the feature fusion process. Recent AVSR methods often adopt mask-based strategies to filter audio noise during feature interaction and fusion, yet such methods risk discarding semantically relevant information alongside noise. This work proposes an end-to-end noise-robust AVSR framework coupled with speech enhancement, eliminating the need for explicit noise mask generation. The framework leverages a Conformer-based bottleneck fusion module to implicitly refine noisy audio features with video assistance, reducing modality redundancy and enhancing inter-modal interactions. This method preserves speech semantic integrity to achieve robust recognition performance.

AGENTRIM is a framework for detecting and mitigating tool-driven agency risks without altering an agent's internal reasoning. AGENTRIM addresses these risks through complementary offline and online phases. Offline, AGENTRIM reconstructs and verifies the agent's tool interface from code and execution traces. At runtime, it enforces step-by-step least-privilege tool access through adaptive filtering and status-aware validation of tool calls.

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data. This work proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines. The results highlight the importance of structured temporal representations and show that decoupling local temporal encoding from global attention-based modelling yields more effective and stable time-series forecasting.",28.22,11.127,314,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

However, current CLAP models face several key limitations. First, they are typically trained on relatively small datasets, often comprising a few million audio samples. Second, existing CLAP models are restricted to short and fixed duration, which constrains their usage in real-world scenarios with variable-duration audio. Third, the standard contrastive training objective operates on global representations, which may hinder the learning of dense, fine-grained audio features. To address these challenges, we introduce Scalable Language-Audio Pretraining (SLAP), which scales language-audio pretraining to 109 million audio-text pairs with variable audio durations and incorporates multiple training objectives. SLAP unifies contrastive loss with additional self-supervised and captioning losses in a single-stage training, facilitating the learning of richer dense audio representations.

We propose a mixed precision framework designed for PointPillars, which first searches for sensitive layers with post-training quantization by quantizing one layer at a time to 8-bit integer (INT8) and evaluating each model for average precision (AP). The top-k most sensitive layers are assigned as floating point (FP). Combinations of these layers are greedily searched to produce candidate mixed precision models, which are finalized with either PTQ or quantization-aware training (QAT). Furthermore, to handle outliers, we observe that using a very small number of calibration data reduces the likelihood of encountering outliers, thereby improving PTQ performance.

However, these formats are kernel-dependent and lack universality for manufacturing. In contrast, the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP, ISO 10303) file is a widely adopted, neutral boundary representation (B-rep) format directly compatible with manufacturing, but its graph-structured, cross-referenced nature poses unique challenges for auto-regressive LLMs. To address this, we curate a dataset of ∼40K STEP-caption pairs and introduce novel preprocessing tailored for the graph-structured format of STEP, including a depth-first search (DFS)-based reserialization that linearizes cross-references while preserving locality and chain-of-thought (CoT)-style structural annotations that explicitly guide global coherence. We integrate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground predictions in relevant examples for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and further refine generation quality through reinforcement learning (RL) with a specific Chamfer Distance-based geometric reward. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our STEP-LLM in geometric fidelity over the Text2CAD baseline, with improvements arising from multiple stages of our framework: the RAG module substantially enhances completeness and renderability, the DFS-based reserialization strategy strengthens overall accuracy, and the RL refinement further reduces geometric discrepancy.

Despite substantial advances in ex ante harm identification and prevention, responsible AI scholarship remains underdeveloped in its treatment of ex post risk governance. Core legal questions regarding compensation, mitigation, attribution of responsibility, liability allocation, and the effectiveness of remedial mechanisms remain inadequately theorized and underinstitutionalized, particularly in relation to transboundary AI harms, AI-induced risks, and damages that transcend national borders, legal jurisdictions, and regulatory authority. Drawing on contemporary AI risk analyses, we argue that such harms are not exceptional but structurally inherent to the AI supply chains, and are likely to increase in both frequency and severity due to globalized deployment, cross-border data infrastructures, and asymmetric national capacities in AI development and oversight, thereby rendering territorially bounded liability regimes increasingly inadequate. Adopting a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, the paper examines compensation and liability mechanisms from adjacent high-risk and transnational domains, including vaccine injury compensation, financial systemic risk governance, commercial nuclear energy liability, and international environmental harm regimes, to identify transferable legal design principles, such as strict liability, pooled compensation mechanisms, and collective risk-sharing, as well as the structural constraints limiting their application to AI-related harms.

Our evaluation shows that visual parameter extraction reduces execution success by 12–21 percentage points (pp), with GPT-5-Mini dropping from 93% to 72%. Program-of-thought prompting decreases performance by up to 13 pp, and open-source models lag behind closed-source ones, with Llama-3.2-11B-Vision reaching 18% compared to 75% for GPT-5-Mini. These results establish baseline capabilities and limitations of current VLMs for optimization code generation within an IBN system. We also demonstrate practical feasibility through a case study that deploys VLM-generated code to network testbed infrastructure using Model Context Protocol.",28.88,14.334,414,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

We introduce PAIR-SAFE, a paired-agent framework for auditing and refining AI-generated mental health support that integrates a Responder agent with a supervisory Judge agent grounded in the clinically validated Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI-4) framework. The Judge audits each response and provides structured ALLOW or REVISE decisions that guide runtime response refinement.

While such approaches achieve interpretable reasoning and strong zero-shot generalization, they assume that intermediate reasoning steps are accurate. However, this assumption causes cascading errors: false detections and invalid relations propagate through the reasoning chain, yielding high-confidence false positives even when no target is present in the image. To address this limitation, we introduce Verification-Integrated Reasoning Operators (VIRO), a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds lightweight operator-level verifiers within reasoning steps. Each operator executes and validates its output, such as object existence or spatial relationship, thereby allowing the system to robustly handle no-target cases when verification conditions are not met.

While knowledge distillation offers a natural and effective approach for model compression, techniques developed for general machine learning tasks are not directly applicable to time series forecasting due to the unique characteristics. To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000×.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a1×1convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model’s internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness.

We reveal a previously overlooked vulnerability in sampling-based iDP mechanisms: while conforming to the iDP guarantees, an individual's privacy risk is not solely governed by their own privacy budget, but critically depends on the privacy choices of all other data contributors. This creates a mismatch between the promise of individual privacy control and the reality of a system where risk is collectively determined. We demonstrate empirically that certain distributions of privacy preferences can unintentionally inflate the privacy risk of individuals, even when their formal guarantees are met. Moreover, this excess risk provides an exploitable attack vector. A central adversary or a set of colluding adversaries can deliberately choose privacy budgets to amplify vulnerabilities of targeted individuals. Most importantly, this attack operates entirely within the guarantees of DP, hiding this excess vulnerability.

However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. This study shows that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analyzing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision–language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity.

At the same time, this growth has led to an increase in hate speech, the main global threat. To improve the reliability of black-box models used for hate speech detection, post-hoc approaches such as LIME, SHAP, and LRP provide the explanation after training the classification model. In contrast, multi-task approaches based on the HateXplain benchmark learn to explain and classify simultaneously. However, results from HateXplain-based algorithms show that predicted attention varies considerably when it should be constant. This attention variability can lead to inconsistent interpretations, instability of predictions, and learning difficulties. To solve this problem, we propose the BiAtt-BiRNN-HateXplain (Bidirectional Attention BiRNN HateXplain) model which is easier to explain compared to LLMs which are more complex in view of the need for transparency, and will take into account the sequential aspect of the input data during explainability thanks to a BiRNN layer. Thus, if the explanation is correctly estimated, thanks to multi-task learning (explainability and classification task), the model could classify better and commit fewer unintentional bias errors related to communities.

To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks.

We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms. Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse.

Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with significantly reduced high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings enabling real-time responses, cost reduction, and energy savings. The multi-layer architecture provides cumulative security improvements across all defense layers, and the semantic caching mechanism not only accelerates inference but also demonstrates that security architectures can simultaneously advance environmental sustainability.

In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher in the time-aware condition (32% vs. 4% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time.

To address this, we revisit autoregressive modeling as a foundation and reformulate diffusion-style training into a structured multi-group prediction process. We propose Any-order Any-subset Autoregressive modeling (A3), a generalized framework that extends the standard AR factorization to arbitrary token groups and generation orders. A3 preserves the probabilistic rigor and multi-layer dependency modeling of AR while inheriting diffusion models' flexibility for parallel and bidirectional generation. We implement A3 through a two-stream attention architecture and a progressive adaptation strategy that transitions pretrained AR models toward any-order prediction.

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses, while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests and reformulating the forward mapping in a discretization-invariant way, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood of solutions conditioned on the design requirement that can be flexibly specified. The likelihood estimated through the ensemble quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations.

This paper introduces the first adversarial framework that exploits realistic weather to attack VLMs, using a two-stage, parameterized perturbation model based on semantic decoupling. In Stage 1, global effects of rainfall are modeled by applying a low-dimensional global modulation to condition the embedding space and gradually weaken the original semantic decision boundaries. In Stage 2, structured rain variations are introduced by explicitly modeling multi-scale raindrop appearance and rainfall-induced illumination changes, and the resulting non-differentiable weather space is optimized to induce stable semantic shifts. The framework generates perturbations that are both physically grounded and interpretable, and experiments across multiple tasks show that even physically plausible, highly constrained weather perturbations can induce substantial semantic misalignment in mainstream VLMs, posing potential safety and reliability risks in real-world deployment.

However, existing agent frameworks often suffer from architectural rigidity, vendor lock-in, and prohibitive complexity that impedes rapid prototyping and deployment. This paper presents AgentForge, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to democratize the construction of LLM-driven autonomous agents through a principled modular architecture. AgentForge introduces three key innovations: (1) a composable skill abstraction that enables fine-grained task decomposition with formally defined input-output contracts, (2) a unified LLM backend interface supporting seamless switching between cloud-based APIs (OpenAI, Groq) and local inference engines (HuggingFace Transformers), and (3) a declarative YAML-based configuration system that separates agent logic from implementation details. We formalize the skill composition mechanism as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and prove its expressiveness for representing arbitrary sequential and parallel task workflows. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates (87.3% on web scraping pipelines, 91.2% on data analysis tasks) while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills (web scraping, data analysis, content generation, RSS monitoring, image generation, and voice synthesis) and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development. AgentForge addresses a critical gap in the LLM agent ecosystem by providing researchers and practitioners with a production-ready foundation for constructing, evaluating, and deploying autonomous agents without sacrificing flexibility or performance.",29.51,17.553,518,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Models achieve perfect accuracy on factual questions and 84-90% on seen tasks. However, accuracy drops sharply on unseen problems (by 30-64%), with failures stemming from systematic misinterpretation of language constraints, incorrect handling of Kleene-star semantics, and a failure to preserve global consistency. We evaluate a three-stage hint protocol that enables correction of shallow errors but does not reliably resolve globally inconsistent or structurally flawed automata.

Cohen",,,"Code-LLMs, round-trip consistency, inversion, code understanding, execution reasoning","Recent progress in Code-LLMs has demonstrated remarkable performance across various software engineering applications. However, evaluating the reasoning ability of Code-LLMs requires going beyond isolated input–output predictions. Most existing code reasoning benchmarks evaluate single-direction execution, either forward or backward. This overlooks a key property of robust reasoning systems: the ability to integrate forward and backward execution into a coherent and reversible process. Forward execution can often be solved through surface-level pattern matching, memorisation, or statistical correlation rather than genuine mechanistic understanding. Inversion, however, is fundamentally different. It requires the model to understand the forward execution as a bijective encoding function and then construct a corresponding decoding function that perfectly recovers the original input. An LLM might achieve high accuracy in one direction, yet fail to maintain logical compatibility when the process is inverted, leading to inconsistencies. Success on a round-trip inversion provides more substantial evidence of deep semantic code understanding than forward-only accuracy. Because inversion cannot be solved by local pattern matching alone, models must implicitly construct a consistent internal execution model. Failures to close the loop and achieve self-consistency thus indicate that forward correctness was fragile, derived from template matching and API memorisation rather than mechanistic reasoning. The paper presents ROUNDTRIPCODEEVAL (RTCE), a comprehensive benchmark consisting of four distinct code execution reasoning tasks designed to rigorously test round-trip consistency. RTCE provides an execution-free, exact-match evaluation of bijection fidelity, assessing whether models preserve a consistent one-to-one mapping between encoding and decoding operations across various algorithms and directions. The paper systematically evaluates state-of-the-art Code-LLMs using zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on execution traces, and self-reflection mechanisms. Each yields modest improvements, but none closes the gap, indicating that current LLMs struggle with true round-trip consistency, which demonstrates that they lack the internal coherence required for trustworthy code reasoning. RTCE surfaces several new and previously unmeasured insights that are not captured by existing I/O-prediction, execution-reasoning, or round-trip natural-language benchmarks.",28.77,17.728,510,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands.

Existing approaches are challenged by two major issues: emotional comorbidity, where multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these issues, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic emotion diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to enhance diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO models instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and introduces a multi-agent collaboration mechanism comprising the Planner–Teacher–Critic–Student–Target roles. This closed-loop design enables continuous optimization of prompt generation, evaluation, and evolution. After the Planner agent formulates a high-level optimization trajectory within the POMDP framework, the Teacher–Critic–Student agents collaboratively refine the prompts along this trajectory, iteratively enhancing the stability and effectiveness of the reasoning process. Finally, the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization or terminate the search based on performance evaluation.

This dependence on manually designed workflows suffers from human biases and makes exploring the broader design space expensive. We introduce AGENTICRED, an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs' in-context learning to iteratively design and refine red-teaming systems without human intervention. Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AGENTICRED treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AGENTICRED consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench.

We gathered textual data from social media and dating apps with users' consent and trained machine learning models to identify various risk behaviors, such as condomless anal sex, number of sexual partners, binge drinking, and heavy drinking. Drinking outcomes were based on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C). We also trained a model to determine whether an individual was using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

However, most approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic, self-organized dynamical system perspective.

We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain.

This study investigates whether these models display a systematic preferential bias in favor of artificial intelligence (AI) itself. Across three complementary experiments, consistent evidence of pro-AI bias is found. First, LLMs disproportionately recommend AI-related options in response to diverse advice-seeking queries, with proprietary models doing so almost deterministically. Second, models systematically overestimate salaries for AI-related jobs relative to closely matched non-AI jobs, with proprietary models overestimating AI salaries more by 10 percentage points. Finally, probing internal representations of open-weight models reveals that 'Artificial Intelligence' exhibits the highest similarity to generic prompts for academic fields under positive, negative, and neutral framings alike, indicating valence-invariant representational centrality.

Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, which are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper reveals that LRMs possess latent reasoning beliefs that can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF) is proposed, a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reﬂective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs.

However, the success of large language models largely relies on extensive human supervision. As the availability of high-quality human-annotated data approaches its limit, this scarcity becomes a fundamental bottleneck for further scaling. Developing reliable and efficient self-evolution mechanisms that operate independently of human data has emerged as a pivotal research frontier. A widely adopted approach for LLM self-evolution is self-play, which establishes a co-evolutionary loop between a Questioner that proposes tasks and a Solver that attempts to solve them. In this paradigm, the Questioner optimizes a difficulty-calibration reward based on the Solver’s current performance, while the Solver is updated on pseudo-labeled data constructed from the tasks generated by the Questioner. To mitigate the challenges of optimization instability and bootstrapping errors, we introduce DARC (Decoupled Asymmetric Reasoning Curriculum), a two-stage framework that stabilizes the self-evolution process. First, we train the Questioner to synthesize difficulty-calibrated questions, conditioned on explicit difficulty levels and external corpora. Second, we train the Solver with an asymmetric self-distillation mechanism, where a document-augmented teacher generates high-quality pseudo-labels to supervise the student Solver that lacks document access. Empirical results demonstrate that DARC is model-agnostic, yielding an average improvement of 10.9 points across nine reasoning benchmarks and three backbone models. Moreover, DARC consistently outperforms all baselines and approaches the performance of fully supervised models without relying on human annotations.

While leveraging diverse teachers seems appealing, effectively fusing their supervisions remains challenging: teacher-student incompatibility risks amplifying hallucinations, and passive supervision fails to ensure genuine logic internalization. To address this, we introduce COMPACT, a framework that adaptively fuses supervisions from different teachers by dynamically weighting teacher gradients based on the student's real-time compatibility evaluated by a multi-dimensional metric. Our experiments and latent space analysis demonstrate that COMPACT effectively integrates diverse reasoning capabilities without damaging the model's original knowledge structure, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting.",28.22,12.581,355,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

While existing methods focus on enhancing speaker encoders, the embedding learning strategy still forces a single fixed-dimensional representation reused for utterances of any length, leaving capacity misaligned with the information available at different durations. We propose Duration-Aware Matryoshka Embedding (DAME), a model-agnostic framework that builds a nested hierarchy of sub-embeddings aligned to utterance durations. Lower-dimensional representations capture compact speaker traits from short utterances, while higher dimensions encode richer details from longer speech. DAME supports both training from scratch and fine-tuning, and serves as a direct alternative to conventional large-margin fine-tuning, consistently improving performance across durations. On the V oxCeleb1-O/E/H and VOiCES evaluation sets, DAME consistently reduces the equal error rate on 1-s and other short-duration trials, while maintaining full-length performance with no additional inference cost.

Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: 'What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV?'

Models trained on noisy data are prone to overfitting, which degrades their generalization performance. While a number of methods and strategies have been proposed to mitigate noisy labels in the segmentation domain, this area remains largely under-explored. The abstention mechanism has proven effective in classification tasks by enhancing the capabilities of Cross Entropy, yet its potential in segmentation remains unverified. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a universal and modular abstention framework capable of enhancing the noise-robustness of a diverse range of loss functions. Our framework improves upon prior work with two key components: an informed regularization term to guide abstention behavior, and a more flexible power-law-based auto-tuning algorithm for the abstention penalty. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by systematically integrating it with three distinct loss functions to create three novel, noise-robust variants: GAC, SAC, and ADS. Experiments on the CaDIS and DSAD medical datasets show our methods consistently and significantly outperform their non-abstaining baselines, especially under high noise levels.

To address these limitations, we introduce a framework for Positioning Objects Consistently and Interactively (POCI-Diff), a novel formulation for jointly enforcing 3D geometric constraints and instance-level semantic binding within a unified diffusion process. Our method enables explicit per-object semantic control by binding individual text descriptions to specific 3D bounding boxes through Blended Latent Diffusion, allowing one-shot synthesis of complex multi-object scenes. We further propose a warping-free generative editing pipeline that supports object insertion, removal, and transformation via regeneration rather than pixel deformation.

Unlike costly human-annotated resources or unreliable synthetic alternatives, our approach systematically produces high-quality, diverse, and legally accurate question-answer pairs directly from authoritative German statutes. Using rigorous automated filtering methods and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, we demonstrate that LLMs adapted with our synthetic dataset significantly outperform their baseline counterparts on German legal question answering tasks. Our results highlight the feasibility of using carefully designed synthetic data as a robust alternative to manual annotation in high-stakes, knowledge-intensive domains.",27.12,9.404,255,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Current solutions often treat this as a direct-to-text generation problem, leading to issues like hallucination, overlooked critiques, and lack of verifiable grounding. To address these limitations, REBUTTALAGENT introduces a multi-agent framework that reframes rebuttal generation as an evidence-centric planning task. The system decomposes complex feedback into atomic concerns and dynamically constructs hybrid contexts by synthesizing compressed summaries with high-fidelity text, integrating an external search module to resolve concerns requiring outside literature. By generating an inspectable response plan before drafting, REBUTTALAGENT ensures that every argument is explicitly anchored in internal or external evidence. The approach is validated on the proposed REBUTTALBENCH, demonstrating superior performance in coverage, faithfulness, and strategic coherence compared to strong baselines. The system offers a transparent and controllable assistant for the peer review process, with code to be released.",27.61,11.229,310,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

The setting involves out-of-context sentences from news and political manifestos, which are challenging due to sparse moral cues and severe class imbalance. The research operationalizes a binary moral presence task and shows that it is learnable from single sentences. A presence-gated hierarchy and a direct multi-label classifier are compared, with the hierarchy not outperforming direct prediction. Lightweight signals and small ensembles are found to yield the most reliable improvements, while hierarchical gating offers limited benefit. The study benchmarks instruction-tuned large language models and builds simple ensembles, achieving significant improvements over single models and prior baselines.",27.84,9.338,260,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

While the effectiveness of agents has continued to improve, efficiency, which is crucial for real-world deployment, has often been overlooked. This paper investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. The paper reviews a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles, including bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency. The paper characterizes efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. The paper also discusses key challenges and future directions, with the goal of providing promising insights.",28.95,13.023,377,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Yang, Hao Bai, Ian Wu, Gene Yang, Amrith Setlur, Aviral Kumar",,2309.14762,"reinforcement learning, large language models, credit assignment, intervention training","Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective at improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. This leads to the problem of credit assignment, where correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. The resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training, improving accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b.",28.48,13.485,384,cold_start,Qwen2.5-3B,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

However, these systems frequently suffer from persona collapse and social sycophancy, leading to redundant, non-constructive dialogue.

MASCOT includes Persona-Aware Behavioral Alignment, which fine-tunes individual agents for strict persona fidelity to prevent identity loss, and Collaborative Dialogue Optimization, guided by group-level rewards to ensure diverse and productive discourse. Extensive evaluations across psychological support and workplace domains demonstrate significant improvements in Persona Consistency and Social Contribution.
