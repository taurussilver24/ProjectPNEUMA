This study develops a robust machine learning framework for one-step-ahead forecasting of daily log-
returns in the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) Index using the XGBoost regressor. A comprehensive
feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical
indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative
Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-
validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-
forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag
configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy
is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (𝑅2)",41.75138473510742,2601.08896v1_XGBoost Forecasting of NEPSE Index Log Returns wit.pdf

The effectiveness of contrastive learning methods has been widely recognized in the field of graph
learning, especially in contexts where graph data often lack labels or are difficult to label. However, the application of these methods to node classification tasks still faces a number of challenges. First, existing data enhancement techniques may lead to significant differences from the original view when
generating new views, which may weaken the relevance of the view and affect the efficiency of model
training. Second",39.14928436279297,2601.10150v1_Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning.pdf
