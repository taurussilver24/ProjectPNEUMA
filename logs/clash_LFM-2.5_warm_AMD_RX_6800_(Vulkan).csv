However, existing systems rely on hardware-intensive multi-camera setups and demand high bandwidth for volumetric streaming, limiting their real-time performance on mobile devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mon3tr, a novel Monocular 3D telepresence framework that integrates 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) based parametric human modeling into telepresence for the first time. Mon3tr adopts an amortized computation strategy, dividing the process into a one-time offline multi-view reconstruction phase to build a user-specific avatar and monocular online inference during live telepresence sessions. A single monocular RGB camera is used to capture body motions and facial expressions in real time to drive the 3DGS-based parametric human model, significantly reducing system complexity and cost. The extracted motion and appearance features are transmitted at <0.2 Mbps over WebRTC’s data channel, allowing robust adaptation to network fluctuations. On the receiver side, e.g., Meta Quest 3, we develop a lightweight 3DGS attribute deformation network to dynamically generate corrective 3DGS attribute adjustments on the pre-built avatar, synthesizing photorealistic motion and appearance at ~60 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, achieving a PSNR of >28 dB for novel poses, an end-to-end latency of ~80 ms, and >1000× bandwidth reduction compared to point-cloud streaming, while supporting real-time operation from monocular inputs across diverse scenarios.

Transformer-based approaches achieve strong accuracy but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, forcing aggressive truncation of user histories and limiting their practicality for long-horizon modeling. This paper presents HoloMambaRec, a lightweight sequential recommendation architecture that combines holographic reduced representations for attribute-aware embedding with a selective state space encoder for linear-time sequence processing. Item and attribute information are bound using circular convolution, preserving embedding dimensionality while encoding structured metadata. A shallow selective state space backbone, inspired by recent Mamba-style models, enables efficient training and constant-time recurrent inference. Experiments on Amazon Beauty and MovieLens-1M datasets demonstrate that HoloMambaRec consistently outperforms SASRec and achieves competitive performance with GRU4Rec under a constrained 10-epoch training budget, while maintaining substantially lower memory complexity. The design further incorporates forward-compatible mechanisms for temporal bundling and inference-time compression, positioning HoloMambaRec as a practical and extensible alternative for scalable, metadata-aware sequential recommendation.",47.1,8.747,412,warm,LFM-2.5,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an M/G/1 queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.",47.92,8.619,413,warm,LFM-2.5,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1×1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model’s internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness. Overall, SL-CBM bridges the gap between concept-based reasoning and spatial explainability, setting a new standard for interpretable and trustworthy concept-based models.",47.29,8.586,406,warm,LFM-2.5,AMD RX 6800 (Vulkan)

To address these issues, we present PREFAB, a low-budget retrospective self-annotation method that targets affective inflection regions rather than full annotation.

Our approach introduces SVGFormer, a decoder-free pipeline built on a content-aware grouping stage that partitions the volume into a semantic graph of supervoxels. Its hierarchical encoder learns rich node representations by combining patch-level Transformer with a supervoxel-level Graph Attention Network, jointly modeling fine-grained intra-region features and broader inter-regional dependencies. This design concentrates all learnable capacity on feature encoding and provides inherent, dual-scale explainability from the patch to the region level. To validate the framework’s flexibility, we trained two specialized models on the BraTS dataset: one for node-level classification and one for tumor proportion regression. Both models achieved strong performance, with the classification model achieving an F1-score of 0.875 and the regression model a MAE of 0.028, confirming the encoder’s ability to learn discriminative and localized features.
